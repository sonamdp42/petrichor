- Malloc Implementation (suggestion by Sagar: Just mmap a large amount of memory
  rather than using brk(), I say explore both options).

- Kernel style linked-lists (suggestion by Sagar: look up how they implement
  containers, etc).

- Page cache implementation.

- Implement a file system (need to explore whether FUSE or VFS based).
