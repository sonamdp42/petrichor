This project contains a set of code I wrote just for fun or as part of a
project which I would like to preserve. Each mini-project shall have its own
directory.

Currently existing code:

1) LRU Cache
2) Lock Free Queue (used in smackd)
3) Hash Table for generic data types (used in smackd)
4) Memory Allocator (malloc style, assignment from:
   http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/notes/Malloc2/lecture.html)
